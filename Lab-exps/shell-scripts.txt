Today's Lab experiments

1. Program for simulation of cp unix commands
ALGORITHM:
STEP1: Start the program
STEP 2:Declare the variables ch, *fp, sc=0
STEP3: Open the file in read mode
STEP 4: Get the character
STEP 5: If ch== “ “ then increment sc value by one
STEP 6: Print no of spaces
STEP 7:Close the file

2. PROGRAM FOR SIMULATION OF LS UNIX COMMANDS
ALGORTIHM:
STEP1 : Start the program
STEP2 : Open the directory with directory object dp
STEP3 : Read the directory content and print it.
STEP4: Close the directory.

3. PROGRAM FOR SIMULATION OF GREP UNIX COMMANDS
ALGORITHM
STEP1: Start the program
STEP2: Declare the variables fline[max], count=0, occurrences=0 and pointers *fp,
*newline.
STEP 3: Open the file in read mode.
STEP4: In while loop check fgets(fline,max,fp)!=NULL13 | P a g e
STEP 5: Increment count value.
STEP 6: Check newline=strchr(fline, „\n‟)
STEP 7: print the count,fline value and increment the occurrence value.
STEP 8: Stop the program

1.Write a Shell program to check the given number is even or odd
ALGORITHM:
SEPT 1: Start the program.
STEP 2: Read the value of n.
STEP 3: Calculate „r=expr $n%2‟.
STEP 4: If the value of r equals 0 then print the number is even
STEP 5: If the value of r not equal to 0 then print the number is odd.
