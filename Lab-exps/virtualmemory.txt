To write a c program to implement Paging technique for memory management.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Declare page number, page table, frame number and process size.
Step 3: Read the process size, total number of pages
Step 4: Read the relative address
Step 5: Calculate the physical address
Step 6: Display the address
Step 7: Stop the process

To write a C program for implementation of FIFO page replacement algorithm.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Declare the necessary variables.
Step 3: Enter the number of frames.
Step 4: Enter the reference string end with zero.
Step 5: FIFO page replacement selects the page that has been in memory the longest time and 
 when the page must be replaced the oldest page is chosen.
Step 6: When a page is brought into memory, it is inserted at the tail of the queue.
Step 7: Initially all the three frames are empty.
Step 8: The page fault range increases as the no of allocated frames also increases.
Step 9: Print the total number of page faults.
Step 10: Stop the program.

To write a c program to implement LRU page replacement algorithm.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Declare the size
Step 3: Get the number of pages to be inserted
Step 4: Get the value
Step 5: Declare counter and stack
Step 6: Select the least recently used page by counter value
Step 7: Stack them according the selection.
Step 8: Display the values
Step 9: Stop the process

To write C program to implement LFU page replacement algorithm.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Declare the size
Step 3: Get the number of pages to be inserted
Step 4: Get the value
Step 5: Declare counter and stack
Step 6: Select the least frequently used page by counter value
Step 7: Stack them according the selection.
Step 8: Display the values
Step 9: Stop the process
