## AIM:

To write C Programs using the following system calls of UNIX operating system fork, exec, getpid, exit, wait, close, stat, opendir, readdir.

*PROGRAM FOR SYSTEM CALLS OF UNIX OPERATING SYSTEMS (OPENDIR, READDIR, CLOSEDIR)*

*ALGORITHM:*

STEP 1: Start the program.

STEP 2: Create struct dirent.

STEP 3: declare the variable buff and pointer dptr. 

STEP 4: Get the directory name.

STEP 5: Open the directory.

STEP 6: Read the contents in directory and print it. 

STEP 7: Close the directory.


*PROGRAM FOR SYSTEM CALLS OF UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM (fork, getpid, exit)*

*ALGORITHM:*

STEP 1: Start the program.

STEP 2: Declare the variables pid,pid1,pid2. 

STEP 3: Call fork() system call to create process. 

STEP 4: If pid==-1, exit.

STEP 5: Ifpid!=-1 , get the process id using getpid(). 

STEP 6: Print the process id.

STEP 7:Stop the program
